The website is done! I'm pretty proud of it, considering I haven't done much with HTML/CSS in a very long time, and needing to find workarounds for the blog and contact form since GitHub Pages doesn't support anything on the backend. The last thing that I had needed to do was write pages describing the projects that are highlighted on the main page, this website and RPI Tours (speaking of which you should go check those out). I typed those up a little bit before I typed this post out, and I think they're looking pretty good. 

I'm going to leave the main page the way it looks right now, and might just always leave every project I've done highlighted on the main page using those kinds of tiles. I've been thinking of putting them three to a row, and then just letting that build down as the number of things I do increases. I'm excited to see what kinds of things I might get through the contact page and the things I'll write about in the future.

Until then!
