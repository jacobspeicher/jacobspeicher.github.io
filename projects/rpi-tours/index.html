				RPI Tours is an iOS application being built for RPI Admissions that will assist prospective students and their families take self-guided tours of the campus. It's built in Swift and provides navigation directions and information for each building in the tour route.
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				Currently Admissions only has the generalized tour of the entire campus and, sometimes, a prospective student athlete will get a tour from a coach or other faculty member of the venues RPI has at the East Campus Athletic Village (ECAV). This app will provide numerous smaller, more focused tours for students to take. These include tours of places such as:
				<ul class="list">
					<li class="item">Freshman Hill</li>
					<li class="item">Academic Buildings (major specific)</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				This allows students to take a greater focus on their tours and know which buildings they will be spending most of their time in.
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				The work I've done on this application has been mostly polishing and bug fixing during the months of June - August 2016. Adding / fixing small things like:
				<ul class="list">
					<li class="item">Network connectivity so the app does not rely on WiFi solely</li>
					<li class="item">A button during the tour prep screen to allow users to recenter the map outlining where their tour will lead them if they get lost in the MapBox map</li>
					<li class="item">Fixing crashes with reaching a destination</li>
				</ul>
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				The biggest addition I've made to the application was the landmark information screen. Users can reach this screen and learn more about the building in front of them by either tappig on annotations on the map, or by tapping on the notification that appears when they reach a landmark destination along their tour.
