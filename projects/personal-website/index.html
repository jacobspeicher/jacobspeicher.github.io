				I started working on this website on July 30, 2016. I decided to make this to:
				<ol class="list">
					<li class="item">Showcase projects</li>
					<li class="item">Have a blog (since removed)</li>
					<li class="item">Brush up on HTML/CSS</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				But, then I remembered that GitHub Pages doesn't allow you to do anything on the backend. But I mean, I haven't done HTML/CSS in such a long time either, and this is free hosting. So I left it on GitHub Pages, and had to find workarounds to the blog and especially the contact form. 
			</p>
			<p class="project-description">
				I didn't want to just be putting my email address directly on the website since that's just asking for spam mail, but I also couldn't build my own form due to GitHub not supporting any backend code of my own. I ended up finding a free service called <a href="https://formspree.io" class="general-link" target="_blank">FormSpree</a>, which is where the form submission actually goes to, and they forward the information from the form to my email. It's <a href="https://github.com/formspree/formspree" class="general-link" target="_blank">open source</a> and emails are sent using SendGrid's API, which I believe is trustworthy enough in a privacy sense (not that I expect to be getting very much, if any, sensitive information sent to me through this contact form).

				The blog was an easier problem to solve. A simple google search of <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=github+pages+blog&oq=github+pages+blog&aqs=chrome.0.0j69i60l2j69i61j0l2.2107j0j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8" class="general-link" target="_blank">"github pages blog"</a> brings up plenty of results that pretty much all suggest something called <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/" class="general-link" target="_blank">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll is a free and <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll" class="general-link" target="_blank">open source</a> static-site generator, that is actually the engine behind GitHub Pages itself. Basically, structure your repository with some specific folders and files, and you can make a functioning blog in a very short amount of time. The hard part is actually getting it to run on your machine, at least it was mildly difficult for me. I used a MacBook Air that was, at the time, running OSX El Capitan, which had introduced write restrictions on some directories, such as the ones that Ruby Gems and Jekyll attempt to install themselves to. It took a bit more searching, but I finally figured out how to be able to run the command <code>jekyll serve .</code> in the directory of the repository on my machine, I just had to preface it with <code>bundle exec</code>.

				I'm fairly happy with the way this site turned out, and I hope it's a fair representation of myself. There's not much left to do with this (besides make it more adaptive/responsive). I don't know if I'll leave the main page the way it is right now, and continue to feature this, or if I'll just put every major project I work on in the same kind of feature and just scale down the size of the tiles when there get to be too many.
